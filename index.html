                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Although the game has a lot of complexity to it, the rules to play it are pretty simple.
                            The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:
                            
                            Rock wins against scissors.
                            Scissors win against paper.
                            Paper wins against rock.</p>
